                    <h2>Chain Stich (ch)</h2>
                    <p>It is often the starting point for creating crochet projects. The chain stitch forms a series of interlocking loops, providing the foundation for subsequent stitches.</p>
                    <p>To make a chain stitch:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begin with a slipknot on your crochet hook.</li>
                        <li>Hold the slipknot in your non-dominant hand and the hook in your dominant hand.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over (bring the yarn over the hook from back to front).</li>
                        <li>Using the hook, draw the yarn through the slipknot, creating a new loop on the hook.</li>
                        <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the desired number of chain stitches, pulling the yarn through each loop to create a chain.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Below is a video tutorial on how to do a chain stitch:</p>

                    <h2>Single Crochet (sc)</h2>
                    <p>The single crochet (abbreviated as sc) is a basic crochet stitch that creates a dense and sturdy fabric. It is one of the fundamental stitches used in crochet projects.</p>
                    <p>To make a single crochet stitch:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Insert your crochet hook into the designated stitch or space.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over (bring the yarn over the hook from back to front).</li>
                        <li>Draw the yarn through the stitch, creating two loops on your hook.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over again.</li>
                        <li>Pull the yarn through both loops on the hook.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Half Double Crochet (hdc)</h2>
                    <p>The half double crochet (abbreviated as hdc) is a crochet stitch that falls in between the height of a single crochet and a double crochet. It creates a slightly taller stitch and is used to add texture and depth to crochet projects.</p>
                    <p>To make a half double crochet stitch:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Yarn over (bring the yarn over the hook from back to front).</li>
                        <li>Insert your hook into the designated stitch or space.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over again.</li>
                        <li>Draw the yarn through the stitch, creating three loops on your hook.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over once more.</li>
                        <li>Pull the yarn through all three loops on the hook.</li>

                    <h2>Double Crochet (dc)</h2>
                    <p>The double crochet (abbreviated as dc) is a commonly used crochet stitch that creates a taller and more open fabric compared to single and half double crochet stitches. It is versatile and can be used in a wide range of crochet projects.</p>
                    <p>To make a double crochet stitch:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Yarn over (bring the yarn over the hook from back to front).</li>
                        <li>Insert your hook into the designated stitch or space.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over again.</li>
                        <li>Draw the yarn through the stitch, creating three loops on your hook.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over once more.</li>
                        <li>Pull the yarn through the first two loops on the hook.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over again.</li>
                        <li>Pull the yarn through the remaining loops on the hook.</li>

                <h1>Joining Yarns and Changing Colors</h1>
                <p>There may be times where while you are working on a project, you find yourself in the dilemma of having to add more yarn to what you are currently crocheting, or perhaps you want to change the yarnâ€™s colors. When it comes to joining yarns and changing colors in crochet, there are several techniques you can use. Here are three commonly used methods:</p>

                    <h2>Knot or Overlap Method</h2>
                    <p>To join a new yarn or change colors using the knot method, you can tie a secure knot with the old and new yarn ends and continue crocheting over the tails, leaving them in place. Alternatively, for the overlap method, you can simply crochet over the tail of the old yarn with the new yarn for a few stitches to secure it.</p>
                    <p>Below is a video tutorial on how to do a knot or overlap method:</p>

                    <h2>Invisible Join or Russian Join</h2>
                    <p>The invisible join is a technique used to seamlessly join a new yarn or change colors. It involves splitting the plies of the yarn and weaving the ends back into the work using a tapestry needle, creating a smooth and invisible transition.</p>
                    <p>Below is a video tutorial on how to an invisible or russian join:</p>

                    <h2>Join-As-You-Go</h2>
                    <p>This technique is commonly used for projects that require joining motifs or squares together as you work. Instead of joining the yarn or changing colors at the end, you incorporate the new yarn or color while working the final stitches of a motif, connecting it to the previous motif as you go.</p>
